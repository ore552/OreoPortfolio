          <h3>This was the first project that contains JavaScript, so it is placed very specially in my coding journey. This calcualtor has the height, mass (how much you weigh if you don't know), and will tell you if you have a good BMI.</h3>

          <h3>This was the second one of the many projects I used, I figdet with it to this day! This is a very basic changer though. This was so random when I played with it! The only colour you may not get is black.</h3>

          <h3>Basically numbers 1 - 9 timestables, it really is fun, 1 minute timer, but it's very generic.you can still play even after the timer stopped - check to understand what I mean. Following the negatives, the design is a bit bland.</h3>

          <h3>This scientific calculator is one of the shortest projects that I did. It took me so little time. That is because it is really easy. I think everyone will enjoy it. One problem though is that you cannot add anything to pi, if you click it you will only get pi and only pi. But all in all, it's a calculator and it does just that!</h3>

          <h3>Like the BMI calculator, this one was a first. It was the first project with pictures in it. It is also the start of the famous Guess?ing Series. This was very basic and was the first front-end Gen 1 game, this was a very good starting point in my eyes, and gave me a lot of things I could add in later games.</h3>

          <h3>I became a bit cocky and launched the second game of the Guess?ng Series, Guess the Car. Since I felt that it should get a bit interesting, I added a minor tweek and made it look like an upgrade, it really made it harder fo people, my pleasure. Even though I took this as a success, it was still very, very in need of advancing.</h3>

          <h3>This one is just one I like to use, I like having a Word made by me, but it really is as basic as it gets. The design was very good but the colours really annoyed me - Pink and all. The counter itself is a very clever way of finding out how many of each so it is really advanced in my opinion.</h3>

I myself loved the design, trying to make it like a game and watch - Nintendo's first console - and it really made me feel happy, so this is from me, enjoy!</h3>
