        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p className='p'>Feast your eyes on all the projects I've done.</p>
        <ul className='cards'>
          <li className='card'>
            <h3>BMI Calculator</h3>
            <button><a href="https://bmi-calculator-fnuo.vercel.app/">Click to enjoy!</a></button>
            <p>This was the first project that contains JavaScript, so it is placed very specially in my coding journey.</p>
          </li>

          <li className='card'>
            <h3>Background Colour Changer</h3>
            <button><a href="https://background-colour-changers.vercel.app/">Click to enjoy!</a></button>
            <p>This was the second one of the many projects I used, I figdet with it to this day!</p>
          </li>

          <li className='card'>
            <h3>Timestable quiz</h3>
            <button><a href="https://multiplication-games.vercel.app/">Click to enjoy!</a></button>
            <p>Basically numbers 1 - 9 timestables, it really is fun, 1 minute timer, but it's very generic.</p>
          </li>

          <li className='card'>
            <h3>Scientific Calculator</h3>
            <button><a href="https://scientific-calculator-creation.vercel.app/">Click to enjoy!</a></button>
            <p>This scientific calculator is one of the shortest projects that I did. It took me so little time. That is because it is really easy. I think everyone will enjoy it.</p>
          </li>

          <li className='card'>
            <h3>Guess the Fruit!</h3>
            <button><a href="https://guess-the-fruit.netlify.app/">Click to enjoy!</a></button>
            <p>Like the BMI calculator, this one was a first. It was the first project with pictures in it. It is also the start of the famous Guess?ing Series.</p>
          </li>

          <li className='card'>
            <h3>Guess the Car!</h3>
            <button><a href="https://661434763e3c19107eafd353--steady-stardust-a020b8.netlify.app/">Click to enjoy!</a></button> 
            <p>I became a bit cocky and launched the second game of the Guess?ng Series, Guess the Car. Since I felt that it should get a bit interesting, I added a minor tweek and made it look like an upgrade, it really made it harder fo people, my pleasure.</p>
          </li>

          <li className='card'>
            <h3>Word Counter</h3>
            <button><a  href="https://6615842fc98b6d15ab6c3a7c--remarkable-baklava-be40a6.netlify.app/">Click to enjoy!</a></button>
            <p>This one is just one I like to use, I like having a Word made by me, but it really is as basic as it gets.</p>
          </li>

          <li className='card'>
            <h3>Js Events</h3>
            <button><a className='a' href="https://ore552.github.io/Javascript-Events/">Click to enjoy!</a></button>
            <p>This I have to say, is my least favorite project I have made, it took me so long to get <strong>every <br /> single <br /> JavaScript <br /> Event <br /></strong>and once I was done, I had to style it, just enjoy.</p>
          </li>

          <li className='card'>
            <h3>Guess the Game</h3>
            <button><a className='a' href="https://661eb7e3e168a4552e528db2--wondrous-syrniki-8ed356.netlify.app/">Click to enjoy!</a></button>
            <p>This one led the idea of a Generation, this one is back-end Gen 1. Like all ends of all tech lines, they are all the old ones with better designs and a new tweeking to get it even better, so this is from me, enjoy!</p>
          </li>

          <li className='card'>
            <h3>Guess the Animal</h3>
            <button><a className='a' href="https://6627fb841469f32dff28634c--genuine-entremet-df7b89.netlify.app/">Click to enjoy!</a></button>
            <p>Take a what I'm going to say with a pinch of salt, this one is the most overrated one of the Guess?ng series and rightly so, this one had all the old tweekings, a new upgrade, the biggest we've seen. But the worst <br /> <h1>Worst</h1> design, please enjoy and try to ignore the other border.</p>
          </li>

          <div className='card'>
              <h3>Weather App</h3>
              <button><a className='a' href="https://heartfelt-tartufo-f98339.netlify.app">Click to enjoy!</a></button>
              <p>The Weather App is a weather app, it has a better design than a normal one, with a gif background.</p>
